If you have never used Julia before, here is a quick guide to
install it so that you can run the benchmark in the accompanying
script "QNLogLikeBenchmark.jl".

The installation procedure below lasts approximately 5 minutes.

1) install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
2) install [Atom](https://atom.io/) and open it
3) in Atom's menu,
 	- go to Settings > install (on some OS: Preferences > install),
	- type "uber-juno" in the search bar
	- install uber-juno

That's it.

**NB**: In some rare cases you may need to add the path to Julia since for some reason it is not accessible to Atom.
To do so, go to Packages > Julia (or julia-client) > Settings and in the
first box for "Julia Path" insert the path to your Julia installation
(example: C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Julia-1.3.0\bin\julia.exe)
