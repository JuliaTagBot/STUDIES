# DIRECTIONS
#
# If you have never used Julia before, read first the accompanying file
# "WhatsJulia_ReadME.txt".
#
# Before running the script, install the required packages. For that,
# execute the following line in Julia's REPL and wait until
# all packages are installed:
#    ]add Statistics, LinearAlgebra, Dates, Random, MAT, Diagonalizations

#
# This scipt benchmarks the quasi-Newton Log-Likelihood Approximate
# Joint Diagonalization (AJD) algorithm of Ablin, Cardoso and
# Gramfort (2019) and the log-likelihood algorithm of Pham (2000)
# on a real EEG database using the julia language.
#
# The accompanying file `Cospectra.mat` holds Fourier cospectra
# computed on 84 eyes-closed resting-state EEG recordings obtained
# on healthy individuals (sampling rate: 128, 19 electrodes placed
# according to the 10-20 int. system, manual artefact rejection of
# corrupted epochs).
#
# For each recording, data has been pre-whitened reducing the dimension,
# if needed, so as to keep the smallest dimension explaining at least
# 99.9% of the total variance. Then, Fourier cospectra have been estimated
# by means of the Welch methods, using 256-sample long 50% overlapping
# epochs and a Harris tapering window (see the documentation of the
# "FourierAnalysis.jl" package), yielding copsectra at 0.5Hz resolution.
#
# The 47 cospectra in the frequency band-pass region 1-24 Hz are submitted
# to the two AJD algorithms. This is a real-case-scenarion usage of AJD
# algorithms as the diagonalizations of such matrices yields a blind source
# separation method specifically tailored for EEG data (Congedo et al., 2008).
#
# For both algorithms the maximum number of iterations is set to 1000
# and the tolerance for convergence is set to 1e-6.
# In order to estimate execution time, for each one of the 84 sets of
# cospectra the two algorithms are run in randomized order `ntrials`
# times and the minimum completion time across trials is retained.
#
# The plot at the end of the script display the minimum completion time
# for the dataset sorted in ascending order for each algorithm.
#
# All computations for the benckmark are carried out on a single
# logical processor. The AJD algorithms are implemented in the
# "Diagonalizations.jl" package.
